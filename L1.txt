1. Introduce ur self?

Good Morning, My name is Sangramsinh Patil.I've been working as a Hadoop Admin in CloudAge Global Services Pvt.Ltd. in pune
since 2018 and it's been 3 years and I am a part of a team who is responsible for running production grade Big data clusters.
The environment that we use are AWS’s cloud environment along with Cloudera’s Distribution of Hadoop (CDH). I have worked on 
many tools and services like HDFS, YARN, ETL tools like Hive, HBase data processing engine like Spark on Yarn and data 
pipelining tools like Kafka. Initially I started working as an Associate where i used to work with the cloud team and would 
do service ticket management and was responsible for handling P3 and P4 tickets along with that I was also responsible for 
cluster monitoring and in the meantime I also learned about several tools like Kafka, Spark, Hive, HBase and got to know about 
the HDFS in deep and did POC on it. Later on after 2 years as a Hadoop associate I got promoted as a Hadoop Admin where my 
roles and responsibilities consisted of incident management handling P2 tickets, cluster upgradation, securing Hadoop cluster 
using authentication, authorization, governance and encryption, checking health of services. Also I interact with the clients 
sometimes. And as the data is increasing day by day which is challenging the businesses to aggregate, understand and use this 
massive jumbles of data.So that's all from my end. Thank you!!!

6.Tell me about a time you showed leadership?
Recently there was a situation where my manager needed to take medical leave and was unable to come into work for a few weeks. This coincided with a major deadline that he was leading. I knew that if this project wasn't completed on time, we were at risk of losing a major client. I looked to my right and my left, and there wasn't anyone else who could own the project, so I jumped in with both feet and took the initiative. I went through the files and developed a schedule detailing what needed to be completed, and I worked with my coworkers to ensure they were on board too. In the end, we were able to complete the project by the deadline. The client was pleased and stayed on as a loyal customer to the company. When my boss came back, he gave me an end-of-quarter bonus because he was impressed I was able to rally everyone to complete the project.

7.Tell me about a time you were successful on a team?
I think that strong organizational skills are some of the most important for a leader to have. My company has an annual summer barbecue, and the person who used to organize the event every year recently left the company for a new job. Since I’d helped them in the past, I volunteered to run it this year. It’s a potluck event and we usually have a few organized activities throughout the day. I sent out a survey to get a feel for who wanted to bring what dishes and which activities people were most interested in.

10.Describe your most challenging project?

So in my earlier project, i was part of a team responsible for clusters Management and the clients requirment for their execution engine changed from Mapreduce to Spark as client was expecting a huge surge in the data volumn in comming weeks and wanted to process the data faster using new execution engine. The project was challenging becasue changing a execution engine takes a lot of planning as i needed to revisit a alot project related aspects, such as cluster planning, resource management, configuration management and performance tuning and i had to do these changes in very short amount of time. I also had to constantly stay in contact with other teams as their applications were connected to our clusters and needed a lot of coordination between all involved teams. We created an in-depth plan for this transition. It required a lot of extra hours. I had to work extra hours ,on weekends to create a plan on how we can manage the resources effectivly with this new engine. It got a bit frustrating as some of the teams were not on schedule with their assigned tasks. But In the end, we did meet our deadlines and we sucessfully
migrated to new execution engine. The client was quite impressed with our efforts.
